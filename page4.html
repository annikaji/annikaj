        In order to make clothes such as scarves and sweaters it is increadibly important you know how to chain-stitch first, before learning how to create the square. <br>
        This is the extension of the chain stitch, so please refer to the chain stitch tutorial first.<br>
        1.	Now that you have your chain stitch, you need to take your crochet hook and insert it into the stitch that is located 2 stitches away from your current stitch<br>
        2.	Then repeat the loop around the crochet hook with the yarn and pull it through the chain stitch only.<br>
        3.	You will now have 2 loops of yarn on your crochet hook. Now loop the yarn around your crochet hook once and pull it through the 2 loops.<br>
        4.	Repeat this to the end of your chain-stitch. And then, on the same side, repeat this process. <br>
        As stated earlier, this will turn into muscle memory over time. </p>
