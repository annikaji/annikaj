        This is the magic ring, it is apart of the fundementals to start crochet amigurumi. <br>
        <br>The method of making the magic ring is: <br>
        1.  Wrap the yarn around the 3 fingers 2 times so that there is a cross on the palm<br>
        2.  Take your corchet hoop and put it under the first loop and grab the second and pull it out so theres a circle<br>
        3.  Chain stitch by making a loop around the crochet hook and pull it through the circle.<br>
        4.  Continue the chain stich for however many stitches are required<br></p>
